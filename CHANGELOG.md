## Breaking Changes
### SLF4J Implementation
This library no longer depends directly on any SLF4J implementation. If you want to see log messages
from this library, you must include an SLF4J implementation in your project.

## Improvements
- Update dependencies
- Make jetbrains annotations compile only
